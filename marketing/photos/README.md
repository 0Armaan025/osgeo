# Photos and Screen Snaps

## Background Photos

The following photos have been provided by Get Interactive as examples of drone photography used in the style guide.

We highly recommend sourcing your own photography or cartographic content appropriate to your community, presentation or target audience. These samples are provided if you are in hurry and match what is used on the website, printed materials and presentation templates.

Choose an appropriate scale (so that trees or infrastructure are visible) allowing guests imagine themselves as part of the landscape.

## Screen snaps

We ask that screen snaps be surrounded in the appropriate device frame (desktop, browser, mobile).

By providing a device we are emphasizing that this technology is a tangible and available for use. This is obstacle for prospective users who are only hearing about open source for the first time.
