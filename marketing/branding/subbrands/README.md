## About "unused" Subbrands

The sub-brands listed in these folders were generated at the start of the website/rebranding process. Many of these did not end up being used either on the website or by their respective communities.

* GeoForAll decided not to use an OSGeo sub-brand, opting instead update their logo by maintaining their distinct emblem and adopting the new OSGeo font and branding colors
* OSGeo Live also decided to adopt a distinct brand with their own emblem and OSGeo font and branding colors
* Case-Studies were replaced by resources on the website in order to attract a wider range of contributions from our community. This idea did not represent require a subbrand.

Consider these folders to contain examples of using the subbrand template and check with the respective community before use.
